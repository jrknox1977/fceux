# FCEUX REST API Project Status

## Overview
This document summarizes the current status of the FCEUX REST API research and Ubuntu build environment setup.

## Completed Work

### 1. Research Phase (46 hours) ✓
All research tasks have been completed and documented:

- **Issue #2**: Core Emulation Loop & Command Queue Integration (12h) ✓
- **Issue #3**: Memory Access Patterns & Thread Safety (8h) ✓
- **Issue #4**: Input System Architecture (8h) ✓
- **Issue #5**: Thread Safety & Qt Integration (10h) ✓
- **Issue #6**: Build System & cpp-httplib Integration (8h) ✓

### 2. Documentation Created ✓

#### Architecture Documentation
- `/docs/architecture/01-main-loop-and-threading.md` - Threading model and integration points
- `/docs/architecture/02-memory-access.md` - Safe memory access patterns
- `/docs/architecture/03-input-system.md` - Input flow and injection points
- `/docs/architecture/04-concurrency-and-qt.md` - Thread safety analysis
- `/docs/architecture/05-build-system.md` - CMake integration strategy
- `/docs/architecture/RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` - Consolidated research findings

#### REST API Documentation
- `/docs/FCEUX_REST_API_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive 700+ line report with:
  - 30+ REST endpoints across 7 categories
  - Screenshot and video streaming endpoints
  - Complete implementation strategy
  - Code examples and client libraries
  - Performance analysis and security considerations

#### Build Documentation
- `/docs/UBUNTU_BUILD_SETUP.md` - Detailed Ubuntu setup guide
- `/docs/BUILD_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide with one-command setup
- `/docs/REST_API_DEPENDENCIES.md` - Additional dependencies for REST API

### 3. Proof of Concepts Created ✓

#### Command Queue Integration
- `/poc/command_queue_hook/` - Demonstrates frame-boundary command injection
- Shows integration with `fceuWrapperUpdate()`

#### Memory Access API
- `/poc/memory_access/memory_api.h` - Thread-safe memory access design
- `/poc/memory_access/memory_api.cpp` - Implementation with async operations

#### HTTP Server Test
- `/poc/http_lib_build/test_server.cpp` - Basic cpp-httplib integration test

#### Screenshot/Video Streaming
- `/poc/rest_api_screenshot/screenshot_test.cpp` - Screenshot capture design
- `/poc/rest_api_screenshot/video_stream_design.cpp` - WebSocket streaming design

### 4. Build Automation ✓
- `/scripts/ubuntu-setup.sh` - Automated setup script that:
  - Detects Ubuntu version
  - Installs all dependencies
  - Clones repository
  - Downloads REST API libraries
  - Builds FCEUX with REST API support
  - Creates convenience scripts
  - Optionally installs system-wide

### 5. Project Configuration ✓
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with build instructions and architecture overview
- Pull Request #8 created and merged with all research

## Current State

The project is now ready to transition from research to implementation phase. The Ubuntu build environment is fully documented and automated.

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: REST API Foundation (Recommended)
1. Implement basic HTTP server infrastructure
2. Add command queue to emulator loop
3. Create core endpoints (pause/resume/status)
4. Test thread safety

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Memory access endpoints
2. Input control endpoints
3. Save state management
4. Basic screenshot endpoint

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. WebSocket video streaming
2. Advanced screenshot options
3. Performance monitoring
4. Authentication system

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Clone and build FCEUX with REST API
