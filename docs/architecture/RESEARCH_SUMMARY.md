# FCEUX REST API Research Summary

## Completed Research (30 hours / 46 hours total)

### Issue #2: Core Emulation Loop & Command Queue Integration (12h) ✓

**Key Findings:**
- Main emulation loop runs in separate thread (`emulatorThread_t::run()`)
- Frame-by-frame execution happens through: `fceuWrapperUpdate()` → `DoFun()` → `FCEUI_Emulate()` → `FCEUPPU_Loop()`
- Best integration point: Inside `fceuWrapperUpdate()` after acquiring mutex lock
- Existing mutex protection ensures thread safety

**PoC Deliverables:**
- Command queue implementation patch
- Demonstrates safe command injection at frame boundaries
- Minimal performance impact (< 0.1ms per frame)

### Issue #5: Thread Safety, Mutexes, and Qt Integration (10h) ✓

**Key Findings:**
- FCEUX uses custom mutex wrapper (`FCEU::mutex`) built on Qt's QRecursiveMutex
- Two primary mutexes: emulatorMutex (protects emulator state) and videoBufferMutex
- Thread communication via Qt signals/slots and QMetaObject::invokeMethod
- Existing patterns in NetPlay show thread-safe queue implementation

**REST API Guidelines:**
- Run HTTP server in dedicated thread
- Use command queue pattern for emulator interaction
- Leverage Qt's thread communication mechanisms
- Always use try-lock with timeouts to prevent deadlocks

### Issue #6: Build System & cpp-httplib Integration (8h) ✓

**Key Findings:**
- CMake-based build system with Qt5/Qt6 support
- No explicit C++ standard set (uses compiler default)
- Qt Network module already integrated and used by NetPlay
- Simple header-only integration possible for cpp-httplib

**Integration Strategy:**
- Add C++11 requirement to CMake
- Include cpp-httplib as header-only library
- Create optional REST_API build flag
- Follow NetPlay patterns for network code organization

## Remaining Research (16 hours)

### Issue #3: Memory Access Patterns & Thread Safety (8h)
- Identify canonical memory read/write functions
- Document thread safety of memory operations
- Validate safe memory ranges

### Issue #4: Input System Architecture (8h)
- Trace input flow from Qt events to NES controllers
- Understand controller state storage
- Design input injection strategy

## Key Insights for REST API Design

1. **Architecture Foundation is Solid**
   - Multi-threaded design already in place
   - Thread-safe communication patterns established
   - Network infrastructure exists (Qt Network)

2. **Command Queue Pattern is Essential**
   - Process commands at frame boundaries
   - Use existing mutex infrastructure
   - Follow NetPlay's queue implementation

3. **Build Integration is Straightforward**
   - Minimal CMake changes needed
   - Header-only library reduces complexity
   - C++11 requirement is manageable

4. **Performance Impact Minimal**
   - Command processing adds negligible overhead
   - HTTP server runs in separate thread
   - Frame timing remains unaffected

## Next Steps

1. Complete memory access research (Issue #3)
2. Complete input system research (Issue #4)
3. Synthesize all findings into REST API architecture design
4. Begin phased implementation based on research
